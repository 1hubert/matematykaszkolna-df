# Motivation
In middle school, [Matemaykaszkolna](matematykaszkolna.pl) was my preffered website for learning math, but I found gif emojis like this: ![](https://matematykaszkolna.pl/forum/emots/1/wesoly.gif) distracting. This bare-bones extension does what I needed it to do, so I'm sharing it for other people to use.
